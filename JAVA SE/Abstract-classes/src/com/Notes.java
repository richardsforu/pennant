	 * ---------
	 * Abstract class
	 * -----------------
	 * => Its  method specification which containws zero or more abstract methods and concreate/ non abstract methods
	 * => Abstract nethod is a method specification. 
	 * => We can not create an object o the abstract class. 
	 * => We can create reference variable to an abstract class
	 * => reference of an abstract class can hold all its implementation / sub classes objects.
	 * => Super class reference can be used to access all the methods in the super class, and all the
	 *    overridden methods in the sub classes
	 * => The reference of a super class can not be used to access the individual methods (methods which are
	 *    present only in the sub class and not avilable in thej super class) of a sub class
	 * 
	 * => If any class is extending from the abstract class, then that class must override all the  
	 *    abstract methods of super class.
	 *    
	 * => If any sub class of an abstract class is not overrridding any one of the abstract methods,
	 *    then that sub class must be defined as 'abstract'
	 * => a class can be defined as either final or abstract . both declaration liek final and
	 *    abstract are not possible or allowed
	 *
